            + The Garry's Mod 9 Project   By Bkerboy +
             + ------------------------------------ +





 Garry's Mod is a modification for Half-Life 2. Since GMod's release in
  December 2004 the history books of modding have been continually re-written.

 Finally, in late 2005, GMod 9.0 was released. The history books now
  simply read "Garry Newman Is GOD". Everything else is just a footnote.



 A few people helped me throw this together, here's the SHOUT OUTZ in a
  warez intro style. n42, DEADBEEF, g33k, Podunkian, helk, andyvincent,
  MrSteak63, hezzy, firerain, appox, DownsP and everyone who I've forgot
  because they are nothings.


 Enjoy!
